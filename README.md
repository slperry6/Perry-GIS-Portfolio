# About Me
<img src="https://github.com/slperry6/Perry-GIS-Portfolio/blob/main/SPerry%20bio.JPG?raw=true">
I am an educator, non-profit leader, and local government analyst. Before coming to Heinz College, I was the Chief Program Officer at an education equity non-profit called Breakthrough CTX. I am a first generation college graduate, and at Breakthrough I worked with students who would be the first in their families to graduate from college. I am committed to public service and love to work with and learn from others.

My research interests include the impact of climate change on migration, social movements, and social policies in the United State and Latin America. I love using GIS as a tool to understand information and use it to tell stories about where we are as we work on where we are going. I am particularly interested in developing systems and staff as a means for organizations to grow and have a positive impact. In the world of GIS this means understanding what technologies are relevant and considering how they can be best implemented.

I currently reside in Pittsburgh, PA and have lived in Austin, Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C, and Connecticut. I have two cattle dogs, Adam and Beau.

# How I think about Spatial Data and Mapping
More than anything, I hope to continue building my analytic ability well beyond my time at Heinz. This semester I have learned different ways to apply GIS in the real world. Spatial data helps us understand things we might not have previously imagined and I hope to not only learn, but also share my understanding as I move forward in my career.
