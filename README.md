# About Me
<img src="https://github.com/slperry6/Perry-GIS-Portfolio/blob/main/SPerry%20bio.JPG?raw=true">
I am an educator, non-profit leader, and local government analyst. Before coming to Heinz College, I was the Chief Program Officer at an education equity non-profit called Breakthrough CTX. I am a first generation college graduate, and at Breakthrough I worked with students who would be the first in their families to graduate from college. I am committed to public service and love to work with and learn from others.

My research interests include the impact of climate change on migration, social movements, and social policies in the United State and Latin America. I love using GIS as a tool to understand information and use it to tell stories about where we are as we work on where we are going. I currently reside in Pittsburgh, PA and have lived in Austin, Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C, and Connecticut. I have two cattle dogs, Adam and Beau.

# What I Hope to Learn
More than anything, I hope to build my analytic ability. I hope to also build my confidence in using ArcGIS and I am eager to learn different ways to apply GIS in the real world. This course is an opportunity for exposure to ways I can make ArcGIS part of my career and I am grateful for anything new I learn.
