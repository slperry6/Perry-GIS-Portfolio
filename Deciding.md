## Training Cases

*Case One: Updating the Homewood Community Profile*

In 2010, Allegheny County DHS published a Homewood Community Profile “to assess demographic changes and examine quality of life issues-poverty, education, health care-in Homewood and in the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County to accurately assess the community’s assets and needs.” The report was requested by the Homewood Children’s Village. The map opens with community assets, churches, community centers, etc. and includes a map of concentration of human services usage in the community. The profile published quantitative data with visualizations and does not include qualitative data or recommendations. 

Now in 2021, the Homewood Children’s Village has requested the profile be updated. You are responsible for creating the updated profile. You meet with a leader from the Homewood Children’s Village and they have serious criticisms of the previous report. In its current form, the profile has brought increased negative attentioned to Homewood and some community leaders believe this has resulted in increased negative outcomes. Your boss says facts are facts and suggests moving forward with the profile by simply updating the figures from the previous report. You are not from Pittsburgh so you have little historical context for Homewood. However, you have heard one person’s criticisms. You also know that DHS is developing practices related to equity and the Department’s role in dismantling harmful systems.

Use the steps above to determine:

1. Should the work be done?
1. If so, should it be published?
1. What changes, if any, are needed?
