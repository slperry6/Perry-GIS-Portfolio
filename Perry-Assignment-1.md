# Breakthrough Central Texas Virtual College Map

Breakthrough Central Texas is an education non-profit that creates a path to and through college for students who will become the first in their families to earn a college degree. Breakthrough starts in 6th grade and continues until college graduation. As of Spring 2021, there are 442 Breakthrough students enrolled in colleges across the United States. While the majority of students attend Texas colleges and universities, Breakthrough CTX students are in Vermont, Washington, D.C., California, and beyond. 

Traditionally, Breakthrough has represented their college students on a map, proudly displayed in the Breakthrough classroom. By creating a virtual version of the map, Breakthrough can continue to communicate students' progress far and wide. This map will serve as the base map for the new Virtual College Map.

The colors for the map come from a modern take on Breakthrough's traditional colors (blue, orange, and white). It was important to decide where to use the bolder colors as highlights and where to have a more subdued tone. The burnt orange color is also a homage to the burnt orange of The University of Texas. At the city level, looking at Austin the orange is well balanced wit the other colors. Most text fill and outline is uniform, with the exception of the street names which appear in a different color for differentiation. Bodies of water and transit lines/stations appear in blue. While this make there appear to be more bodies of water than there actually are, it was a nice way to differentiate colors. Below are examples of the state and country level maps.

When taken on a larger scale, the orange becomes less balanced (and the extended UT Austin metaphor heavy handed). While the map will be interactive, allowing users to zoom into specific cities and towns to see college sties, it will also be viewed at the state and country level. Because of this, I have created an alternate version of the map where the orange and tan colors are reversed. This creates a more subtl option for the organization to consider.

### The following is a step-by-step overview of the process I used to create the map and add it to my portfolio:
1. I searched for a Breakthrough image to pull the color palette and ran it through Adobe
1. I converted the hex codes to rgb codes and create a chart with the information
1. I created a table for the Feature Type, Element Type, Styler, and RGB codes I would use. I want to note, I originally just worked out of the styling wizard directly. It became difficult to keep track of my edits and the colors I was using. Taking the time to get organized first made the process go more slowly.
1. I opened Google's styling wizard tool and went to advanced options to work through my table of edits to make. I kept track of things I might want to review or change later, once I had my initial changes made.
1. I downloaded Sublime and created my JSON text file. I uploaded the file.
1. I created a folder for images on my repo.
1. I used Sublime to write my GitHub Page, periodically checking to make sure it worked before moving on.
1. I uploaded my .md text file.
